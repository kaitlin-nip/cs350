Kaiyik Nip Assignment 1 README file

TO COMPILE: run command "make cs350sh"

TO RUN: run command "./cs350sh"

NOTES:
1) I borrowed Professor Gopalan's signal_handler code to handle ctrl-c, so that if you press ctrl-c in subprocess, the parent process will catch it and not be interrupted.
2) To exit shell, type command "exit" (because ctrl-c is caught)
3) In order to list each finished subprocess once, I left finished subprocesses as zombies until "listjobs" is called. Then they are reaped.
